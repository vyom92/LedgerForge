# PROJECT STATE

This document is the permanent, authoritative handoff between development sessions.

It records only verified project state. Temporary planning, implementation notes, build logs and reasoning belong in `Project documents/Codex response.md`.

Principles:
- Facts only.
- Repository-verifiable information only.
- Minimal manual editing.
- Updated only after successful build, required validation, commit, push and tag when applicable.

# Sprint 14

## Objective
Introduce the deterministic Parser Selection Framework while preserving Statement Classification behaviour and preparing for FinancialDocument Integration.

## Status
Completed

## Outcome

Introduce FinancialDocument as the canonical immutable handoff after Statement Parser and before Validation.

## Status
Completed

## Outcome
- Immutable FinancialDocument model implemented.
- FinancialDocumentBuilder implemented without financial recalculation.

- Build passed.
- Commit: `29c50a9970e74396a7d9be4391efea59b77df4c9`
- Git push to `origin/main` completed successfully.
- Git tag: `sprint-15-complete`

# Sprint 16

## Objective
Migrate StatementParser so every production parser returns FinancialDocument directly instead of [Transaction].

## Status
Completed

## Outcome
- StatementParser now returns FinancialDocument directly.
- AxisBankAccountParser now returns FinancialDocument while preserving existing transaction extraction behaviour.
- ImportEngine now consumes parser-produced FinancialDocument directly.
- FinancialDocumentBuilder was removed after all production and test references were migrated.
- Approved Axis CSV financial truth remains unchanged.
- Existing validation, repository, store and UI behaviour preserved.
- 46 required Sprint 16 regression tests passed through Xcode.
- Build passed.
- Commit: `7013d99e55a5cdcf750cf5ad783a71168d59ee3e`
- Git push to `origin/main` completed successfully.
- Git tag: `sprint-16-complete`

---

# Sprint 17

## Objective
Refine the validation pipeline while preserving the parser-produced FinancialDocument boundary introduced in Sprint 16.

## Status
Completed

## Outcome
- Dedicated ImportValidator regression tests added.
- Empty import validation behaviour verified.
- FinancialDocument validation equivalence to transaction validation verified.
- Valid FinancialDocument validation verified.
- Validation immutability verified.
- ImportValidator production implementation left unchanged because tests exposed no real implementation issue.
- Approved Axis CSV financial truth remains unchanged.
- Existing parser, repository, store and UI behaviour preserved.
- 53 required Sprint 17 regression tests passed through Xcode.
- Build passed.
- Commit: `dcac92a0d8e5078a3014e7ef52af8917f130940d`
- Git push to `origin/main` completed successfully.
- Git tag: `sprint-17-complete`

## Current Work

Active Sprint: Sprint 18

Objective:
- Next recommended sprint: Repository Integration Cleanup.

Scope:
